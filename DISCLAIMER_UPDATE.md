# Disclaimer System Update

## Overview
The disclaimer system has been updated to meet your specific requirements:

1. **Background**: Shows the landing page behind the disclaimer (no background image)
2. **Session-based**: Disclaimer acceptance clears when browser is closed
3. **Enhanced UX**: Added DISAGREE button with proper handling

## Key Changes Made

### ✅ **Background Appearance**
- **Removed**: Background image from disclaimer popup
- **Changed**: Overlay transparency from `bg-black/60` to `bg-black/40` for better visibility
- **Result**: Landing page is visible behind the disclaimer with a subtle dark overlay

### ✅ **Session Management**
- **Changed**: From `localStorage` to `sessionStorage`
- **Removed**: 30-day expiration logic (no longer needed)
- **Result**: Disclaimer acceptance is cleared when browser tab/window is closed

### ✅ **User Experience**
- **Added**: DISAGREE button with proper styling
- **Behavior**: DISAGREE redirects user away from site or goes back in browser history
- **Design**: Matches the screenshot with AGREE (yellow) and DISAGREE (gray) buttons

## Technical Implementation

### Storage Change
```typescript
// Before (localStorage - persists after browser close)
localStorage.setItem('solv-disclaimer-accepted', 'true');

// After (sessionStorage - clears when browser closes)
sessionStorage.setItem('solv-disclaimer-accepted', 'true');
```

### Visual Changes
```typescript
// Before (dark with background image)
className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/80 backdrop-blur-sm z-[9999]"
backgroundImage: 'url("...")'

// After (lighter overlay, no image, landing page visible)
className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/40 backdrop-blur-sm z-[9999]"
```

### Button Handling
```typescript
const handleDisagree = () => {
  if (window.history.length > 1) {
    window.history.back(); // Go to previous page
  } else {
    window.location.href = 'https://www.google.com'; // Redirect away
  }
};
```

## User Experience Flow

### First Visit
1. User lands on website
2. Disclaimer popup appears over landing page (landing page visible through overlay)
3. User sees AGREE and DISAGREE buttons
4. **AGREE**: Disclaimer disappears, user can browse site
5. **DISAGREE**: User is redirected away from site

### Subsequent Visits (Same Session)
1. If user previously clicked AGREE, no disclaimer shown
2. User can browse site normally

### After Browser Close/Reopen
1. Disclaimer acceptance is cleared automatically
2. User sees disclaimer again on next visit
3. Must accept again to browse site

## Benefits

### ✅ **Legal Compliance**
- Ensures users see disclaimer on every browser session
- Cannot be bypassed by clearing cookies/localStorage
- Proper legal acknowledgment required each session

### ✅ **User Experience**
- Landing page remains visible for context
- Clear AGREE/DISAGREE options
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Professional legal appearance

### ✅ **Technical Benefits**
- Simpler code (no date checking or expiration logic)
- Automatic cleanup when browser closes
- No persistent storage concerns
- Better privacy (no long-term tracking)

## Files Modified

1. **`DisclaimerPopup.tsx`**
   - Removed background image styling
   - Reduced overlay opacity for better visibility
   - Added DISAGREE button with proper handler

2. **`DisclaimerManager.tsx`**
   - Changed from localStorage to sessionStorage
   - Removed date-based expiration logic
   - Simplified acceptance checking

## Testing

### Test Session Clearing:
1. Visit site → Accept disclaimer
2. Browse site normally (no disclaimer)
3. Close browser completely
4. Reopen browser and visit site
5. ✅ Disclaimer should appear again

### Test Visual Appearance:
1. Visit site → Disclaimer appears
2. ✅ Landing page should be visible behind dark overlay
3. ✅ Two buttons: AGREE (yellow) and DISAGREE (gray)

### Test Button Functionality:
1. Click DISAGREE → Should redirect away or go back
2. Click AGREE → Disclaimer should disappear smoothly

The disclaimer now works exactly as requested - shows every time the browser is closed/reopened, with the landing page visible in the background!
